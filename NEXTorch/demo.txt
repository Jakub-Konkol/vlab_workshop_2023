We will use Google Colab for this demo.

Head to https://colab.google/ and sign in using your preferred Google account. 

Import the notebook from this GitHub link https://github.com/VlachosGroup/nextorch/blob/main/examples/notebooks/01_simple_1d.ipynb. 


Create a new code cell on the top and key in `! pip install nextorch`. Click run, you should see a downloading message ("Downloading nextorch-0.4.0. tar.gz") 

Run the rest of the notebook, and have fun!
